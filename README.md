# Digital Oscilloscope Based on FPGA  
**Final Year Project | Alinx AX309 Spartan-6 & AD9226 ADC**

This project implements a digital oscilloscope using the Alinx AX309 Spartan-6 FPGA board and AD9226 ADC.  
It performs real-time analog signal sampling and displays the waveform via VGA output.

## Features  
- 12-bit, 65 MSPS AD9226 ADC for high-speed data acquisition  
- Real-time signal processing on Spartan-6 FPGA using VHDL  
- VGA output for waveform visualization
